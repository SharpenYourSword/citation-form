This is a simple Apple services menu item to help with choosing the "correct" abbreviation in your formal legal citations.

I take no responsibility for the wisdom or the quality of the actual abbreviations here.  Some are amazingly ugly; many are nearly inscrutable.  But these are adopted from the canonical list that other lawyers follow.  And as with many things in our fashion-focused profession, we value staying with the pack, even when it does not add clarity.

# Who can use this?

You need to be:

* a Mac OS X user, preferably with Leopard or Snow Leopard,

* are willing to walk through a brief installation process (more than one click, but not much more); and

* use software that is friendly to that Services menu, such as Apple's Pages word processor or your favorite blog editor.  (Microsoft Word 2008 is not Services-friendly.)

If you're still reading, welcome! That last requirement makes this a small club. But I suspect that more and more lawyers will be using Pages as their primary word processor, both because of wider Mac adoption and because of tools such as the iPad.  Personally, I like how much smoother it runs than Word and its more advanced typographic features.

I am optimistic that Microsoft will enable Services in Word 2011.  If they do not, then it's hard for me justify using their product instead of one that I can customize.

# How to use it

Select the case name (highlighting it works fine), then from the Services menu, select the name you gave this service.

If you assigned it a keyboard shortcut (the "extra credit" step), then you have an easier way to do this.  Just highlight the case name and hit your shortcut keys.

# How to suggest edits

If you see an error, feel free to contact me directly.  I am particularly interesting in "errors" that prickle the sensibility of freshly minted law clerks, such as deviations from the canons of legal citations.
