This is a simple **Apple services menu** item to help with choosing the "correct" abbreviation in your formal legal citations.

I take no responsibility for the wisdom or the quality of these abbreviations.  Some are amazingly ugly; many are nearly inscrutable.  But these are patterned from the canonical list that other lawyers follow.  And as with many things in our fashion-focused profession, we value staying with the pack, even when it hurts.

# Who can use this?

You need to:

* be a Mac OS X user, preferably with Leopard or Snow Leopard,

* be willing to walk through a brief installation process (more than one click, but not much more); and

* use software that is friendly to the built-in Services menu, such as Apple's Pages word processor or your favorite blog editor.  (Microsoft Word 2008, however unfortunately, is not Services-friendly.)

If you're still reading, welcome! That last requirement makes this a small club. But I suspect that more and more lawyers will be using Pages as their primary word processor, both because of wider Mac adoption and because of tools such as the iPad.  Personally, I value how much more smoothly it runs on my laptop than Word and the more advanced typographic features of Pages.

I am not too optimistic that Microsoft will include compatibility with the Services menu in Word 2011.  If they do not, then it's hard for me justify using their product instead of one that I can customize.

# How to use it

Select the case name (highlighting it works fine), then from the Services menu, select the name you gave this service.

If you assigned it a keyboard shortcut (the "extra credit" step), then you have an easier way to do this.  Just highlight the case name and hit your shortcut keys.

# How to suggest edits

I am particularly interested in "errors" that prickle the sensibility of freshly minted law clerks, such as deviations from the canons of legal citations.

If you see an error, feel free to contact me directly.  My email address and twitter handle are available on my Github profile page (http://github.com/doncruse).  Or, if you are a member of Github, feel free to submit any errors on the "Issues" page using the menu at the top of this page.  That lets other users know that a particular error has been reported, and it lets you track the progress of any fix.
