This is a simple "services menu" item to help with abbreviating the names of legal cases.

I take no responsibility for the wisdom or the quality of the actual abbreviations here.  These are adopted from the canonical list that other lawyers follow.  Some of them are amazingly ugly and nearly inscrutable.  But, as with many things in the law, we value staying with the pack.

# Who can use this?

Right now, it's a very small set of people.  You need to be:

* a Mac OS X user, preferably with Leopard or Snow Leopard, and

* a user of the Pages word processor rather than Microsoft word.

If you're still reading, welcome! It's a small club. But I suspect that more and more lawyers will be using Pages as their primary word processor, both because of wider Mac adoption and because of tools such as the iPad.  Personally, I like how much smoother it runs than Word and its more advanced typographic features.

But the real reason it does not work in Word is simple: Word 2008 for Mac does not support what are called "services" within the Mac operating system. The "services menu" lets other people write short scripts to interact with your program.  The services menu is enabled in many much simpler apps by much smaller companies. But Microsoft chose not to enable that menu.
